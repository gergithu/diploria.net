      <h1>The Diploria workflow was built under pressure — not in theory.</h1>
      <p>
        This isn’t a thought experiment. It started when I faced a real, high-stakes legal matter. Instead of handing everything to a law firm, I used my time, experience, and AI tools to understand the case myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not publishing details or naming anyone here. What I can share is the method: how I kept facts straight, stayed organized, and produced writing that could stand up in court conversations.
      </p>

    <section id="cs-deliver" class="section">
      <h2>What I deliver (plain language)</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          I turn your situation into:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>A clear summary</strong> – what’s going on, in normal language.</li>
          <li><strong>A simple timeline</strong> – what happened, when, based on the records.</li>
          <li><strong>A short “missing pieces” list</strong> – what still needs to be requested or confirmed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That way you know what to do next and how to explain it to someone else.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="cs-why" class="section">
      <h2>Why this exists</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          When the accusation landed, I knew a traditional defence could easily reach tens of thousands of dollars in fees over a year. I didn’t have that kind of runway.
        </p>
        <p>
          I did have three things:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Time — more than someone working full-time.</li>
          <li>Experience — decades of running my own sales agency, managing myself and my pipeline.</li>
          <li>Curiosity — I wanted to see how far careful use of AI could really go.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          So instead of freezing or outsourcing everything, I treated the situation like a project. That’s where Diploria comes from.
        </p>

    <section id="cs-year" class="section">
      <h2>What the year actually required</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multiple court dates</strong> — including self-represented appearances where I had to speak clearly, briefly, and respectfully.</li>
          <li><strong>Ongoing disclosure</strong> — hundreds of pages, hospital records, warrants, police notes, and 24 GB of body-cam footage.</li>
          <li><strong>Tight timelines</strong> — requests, responses, and deadlines that couldn’t be missed.</li>
          <li><strong>Detailed review</strong> — spotting gaps, contradictions, and possible Charter issues in how things were handled.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          None of this was casual. Every letter, timeline, and request had to be careful and accurate enough to be taken seriously.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="cs-ai" class="section">
      <h2>Where AI actually helped</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Understanding the law</strong> – AI surfaced relevant case law and Charter principles I could then verify in real sources.</li>
          <li><strong>Flagging what was missing</strong> – when disclosure looked thin or inconsistent, I could ask targeted follow-up questions.</li>
          <li><strong>Drafting in professional language</strong> – motions, letters, and emails were drafted with proper structure, then edited by me.</li>
          <li><strong>Pressure-testing my thinking</strong> – I ran the same issue through multiple models to see where they agreed or disagreed.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I still had to decide what to do. AI didn’t replace judgment, but it made the research and drafting humanly possible.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="cs-limits" class="section">
      <h2>Limits & honesty</h2>
      <div class="card">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>I was fortunate.</strong> Hard work and discipline helped, but there was still luck. I won’t pretend everyone can or should do this alone.</li>
          <li><strong>This isn’t legal advice.</strong> I’m not a lawyer. I’m careful about that line.</li>
          <li><strong>What I can offer you</strong> is the part that travels: organizing, clarifying, and writing so you can talk to the right people with confidence.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you’re carrying a complicated situation — legal, medical, financial, or family — and you need it to make sense on paper, that’s where this experience becomes useful for someone else.
