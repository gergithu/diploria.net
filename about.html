    <h1>Why “Diploria”?</h1>
    <p>
      Diploria is a type of brain coral. It grows slowly, layer by layer, over years. From above, you see a maze of ridges — complicated, but patterned.

    <p>
      The name fits the kind of work I care about: taking something that looks tangled and slowly building a clear, solid structure underneath. Not hype, not shortcuts — just careful thinking supported by the best tools we have.

      This page will eventually hold more of that story: how I got here, what I’ve learned from a career in sales and self-directed work, and how that meshes with AI.
